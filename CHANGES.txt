1.4.0
 * --log-posts is only turned on explicity. Prior to 1.4.0 it was
   turned on automatically when pipeing output. This was just
   confusing.
 * Adds run --hash argument to require a specific SHA256 of the input
   script.
 * Adds run --signature argument require that the input script match
   the given gpg signature file.
 * Fixes scripts that need an interactive tty. Must use -1. -1 will
   probably be the default in a future release.
 * run SCRIPT can now be a URL in addition to a file path.
 * --ssl now always requires a CERTIFICATE. You must specify the cert
   as '-' if you want to use self-signed auto-generated certificate.
 * Adds --encrypt, --passphrase, and --encrypt-to options for GPG
   encryption of the resource.

1.3.1
 * Adds path to curlbomb python modules in --version output.
 * Allow HTTP HEAD requests to / and /r without increasing num_gets or
   requiring a knock.
 * Outputs warning message if using --ssh and the forward isn't working
 * --ssl can be used with specifing a CERTIFICATE path, in this case
   generating a temporary self-signed cert.
 * Adds --pin parameter to give the client curl command the SSL fingerprint
   bypassing the client machine's root CA.
 
1.3.0
 * Modular rewrite - the single .py file was getting a wee bit unwieldy
 * Adds ping subcommand
 * Adds ssh-copy-id subcommand
 * Adds support for loading GPG encrypted scripts into the server
 * Adds ability to specify your own knock parameter with --knock
 * Fixes '-n 0' to serve a script an unlimited number of times
 * Adds -1 paramater as a one-shot curlbomb that does not wait for client output
 * Removes the -k option to have no knock. It was a bad idea to use a
   short option for that and it had a counter-intuitive mnemonic. Use
   --disable-knock now, or even better, use the --knock parameter and
   specify an easy-to-remember knock.

1.2.0
 * Adds put/get subcommands for transferring files and directories.
 * Adds run subcommand for running scripts, but only required if
   specifying a file path, can still pipe data to curlbomb without
   args.

1.1.2
 * Removes formatting in --log-posts so that the text is exactly as
   the client sent it.

1.1.1
 * Adds --domain option to specify the domain name to display in the
   client command

1.1.0
 * Complete rewrite of curlbomb using Tornado
