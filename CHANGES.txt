1.3.0
 * Modular rewrite - the single .py file was getting a wee bit unwieldy
 * Adds ping subcommand
 * Adds ssh-copy-id subcommand
 * Adds support for loading GPG encrypted scripts into the server
 * Adds ability to specify your own knock parameter with --knock
 * Fixes '-n 0' to serve a script an unlimited number of times
 * Adds -1 paramater as a one-shot curlbomb that does not wait for client output
 * Removes the -k option to have no knock. It was a bad idea to use a short option for that and it had a counter-intuitive mnemonic. Use --disable-knock now, or even better, use the --knock parameter and specify an easy-to-remember knock.

1.2.0
 * Adds put/get subcommands for transferring files and directories.
 * Adds run subcommand for running scripts, but only required if
   specifying a file path, can still pipe data to curlbomb without
   args.

1.1.2
 * Removes formatting in --log-posts so that the text is exactly as the client sent it.

1.1.1
 * Adds --domain option to specify the domain name to display in the client command

1.1.0
 * Complete rewrite of curlbomb using Tornado
